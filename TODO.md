# TODO - General
- [ ] Conclude with FCNN weight decay management implementation
- [ ] Update doc with xml config, picoPi2 TTS use, new network type enums...
- [ ] Optimization works:
    - [ ] try a fast exp(x) implementation for sigmoid function
    - [ ] Try to use boost specific containers (static_vector etc...)
    - [ ] Try to use boost bounded_array as ublas matrix/vector storage
    - [ ] Work with compiler flags (fast-math, simd flags etc...)
- [ ] Work on a better networks class refactoring (factorization...)
- [ ] Work on CNN implementation

# TODO - Face recognition
- [ ] Canny vs Sobel proper benchmark
- [ ] Use dual Canny/Sobel nets?
