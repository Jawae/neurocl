# neurocl
Neural networks implementations

## Prerequisite:
- [Boost C++](https://github.com/boostorg)
- [VexCL](https://github.com/ddemidov/vexcl)
- [CImg](https://github.com/dtschump/CImg)

## Building:

```
$ sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
$ git clone https://github.com/dtschump/CImg.git
$ git clone https://github.com/ddemidov/vexcl.git
$ git clone https://github.com/blackccpie/neurocl.git
$ cd neurocl
$ sh build_gcc.sh
```

## User Guide:

neurocl requires three main input files:

1. the topology description file: this is a structured text file describing the neural net layers.
```
layer:0:28x28
layer:1:6x6
layer:2:10x1
```
2. the neural net weights file: this is a binary file containing the layers weight and bias values. This file is managed internally by neurocl, but user has to specify the name of the weights file to load for training/classifying.

3. the training set description file: this is a structured text file containing a list of image sample locations along with their expected output vectors. This file is only useful for net training steps.
